                <h2>Terms of Service for DailyForge</h2>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 18, 2025</p>

                <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the DailyForge mobile application (the "Service") operated by DailyForge ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

                <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

                <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

                <h3>1. The Service</h3>
                <p>DailyForge provides a habit tracking and daily planning application designed to help users build positive habits, overcome addictions, and organize their daily activities. The Service includes features such as a life visualizer, daily success radar, habit tracking, and a daily planner.</p>

                <h3>2. User Accounts</h3>
                <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us with information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
                <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

                <h3>3. Subscriptions ("Artisan" Plan)</h3>
                <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
                <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or DailyForge cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.</p>
                <p>A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your Subscription. All billing is handled by the respective platform's app store (Google Play Store, Apple App Store), and we are not responsible for the processing of payments, refunds, or payment disputes.</p>
                <p>We, in our sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

                <h3>4. Content</h3>
                <p>Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness. All data you generate, such as habit entries, daily plans, and notes, is stored locally on your device or, if you have an account, synced to our servers.</p>

                <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of DailyForge and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the designated governing country and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of DailyForge.</p>

                <h3>6. Termination</h3>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
                <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so through the "Account" section within the application's settings.</p>

                <h3>7. Limitation Of Liability</h3>
                <p>In no event shall DailyForge, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

                <h3>8. Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.</p>
                <p>DailyForge its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.</p>

                <h3>9. Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

                <h3>10. Changes</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
