                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 17, 2025</p>

                <p>Welcome to DailyForge. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our mobile application.</p>

                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

                <h4>1. Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and name provided during sign-up (e.g., via Google Sign-In).</li>
                    <li><strong>User Content:</strong> We store the data you create within the app, such as your habits, daily plans, and life visualization attributes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Information We Collect Automatically:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to our Premium version, we process transaction information through our third-party service provider, RevenueCat, which communicates with the Google Play Store. To enable these transactions, our app uses the standard billing permissions required by the app store. We do not directly store your credit card details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Push Notification Tokens:</strong> If you grant permission for notifications, we collect a push notification token to send you reminders and motivational messages. This token allows our servers to send notifications to your specific device but does not personally identify you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device and Usage Information:</strong> We may collect basic, non-identifiable information about your device and how you use the app to help us fix bugs and improve our services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

                    <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
                    <li>Process your subscriptions and transactions.</li>
                    <li>Send you reminders about your habits and other relevant app updates, if you have enabled notifications.</li>
                    <li>Communicate with you, including sending you service-related announcements.</li>
                    <li>Personalize your app experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
                <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with the following third parties to make our service function:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> We use Firebase for backend services, including authentication, database storage, and cloud functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Play / App Store:</strong> To process payments for subscriptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expo (Expo Application Services):</strong> We use Expo's services to manage and deliver push notifications to your device.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These service providers have access to your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

                <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete the information we have on you. You can manage your data directly within the app's account settings or by contacting us.</p>
